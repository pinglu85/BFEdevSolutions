# 67. create your own Promise

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-your-own-Promise

#

### Problem Description

[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) is widely used nowadays, hard to think how I handled [Callback Hell](http://callbackhell.com/) in the old times.

Can you implement a `MyPromise` Class by yourself?

At least it should match following requirements

1. new promise: `new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {})`
2. chaining : `MyPromise.prototype.then()` _[then handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) should be called asynchronously_
3. rejection handler: `MyPromise.prototype.catch()`
4. static methods: `MyPromise.resolve()`, `MyPromise.reject()`.

This is a challenging problem. Recommend you read about Promise thoroughly first.

#

### Understanding the problem

We are asked to build our own `Promise` class that fulfills the following requirements:

1. the `new Promise` constructor accepts a callback function as an argument. The callback function receives two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`.
2. `MyPromise.prototype.then()` can be chained. `MyPromise.prototype.then()` takes in two callback functions, which should be executed asynchronously.
3. it should has a method `MyPromise.prototype.catch()` to handle rejection.
4. it should has two static methods: `MyPromise.resolve()`, `MyPromise.reject()`, so we can write e.g.`MyPromise.resolve('foo').then(() => {})`.

#

### Approach

#### The Constructor of `MyPromise`

The `promise` object created by the class `Promise` has a `state` property. Initially, the `state` is `pending`. Thus, in the constructor of the `MyPromise` class, we would define a property `state` and initialize it to `'pending'`.

```js
class MyPromise {
  #state;

  constructor() {
    this.#state = 'pending';
  }
}
```

&nbsp;

#### Handling the function passed to `new Promise()`

The function is called the **executor**. It is executed immediately and automatically by `new Promise()` and is able to either `resolve` or `reject` the promise. Hence, we would call the function in the `constructor` with the arguments `resolve` and `reject`.

If the executor function throws any errors, the promise will be rejected. To address this, we could make use of the `try...catch` statement and reject the promise in the `catch` block.

```js
class MyPromise {
  constructor(executor) {
    // ...
    try {
      executor(/* resolve */, /* reject */);
    } catch (error) {
      // reject the promise
    }
  }
}
```

&nbsp;

#### Implementing `resolve` and `reject` passed to the executor function

A executor function that resolves the promise looks like this:

```js
function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('Done!');
  }, 1000);
}
```

A executor function that rejects the promise looks like so:

```js
 function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject(new Error('Something went wrong!'));
  }, 1000);
}
```

Therefore `resolve` and `reject` are both functions which receive one argument. We could define the two methods on the class `MyPromise` with the following signatures:

```js
class MyPromise {
  // ...

  #resolve(value) {}

  #reject(reason) {}
}
```

When `resolve()` is called, the `state` of the `promise` is changed to `'fulfilled'`; when `reject()` is called, the `state` is changed to `'rejected'`.

Besides the `state` property, the `promise` object also has a `result` property to store the promise result. Initially, it is set to `undefined`. Its value changes either to the resolved value if `resolve()` is called, or to the rejected value if `reject()` is called.

In addition, a `Promise` can only be resolved or rejected once.

Thus, we could implement our `resolve()` and `reject()` methods like so:

```js
#resolve(value) {
  // Ensure the promise is only resolved or rejected once.
  if (this.#state !== 'pending') return;

  this.#state = 'fulfilled';
  this.#result = value;
}

#reject(reason) {
  // Ensure the promise is only resolved or rejected once.
  if (this.#state !== 'pending') return;

  this.#state = 'rejected';
  this.#result = reason;
}
```

Since `this.#resolve()` and `this.#reject()` are passed to the executor function as parameters, [`this` inside the two methods will refer to the global object instead of the `promise` object](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md#implicitly-lost). Therefore we need to `bind` both methods in the `constructor` or use the experimental fat arrow class methods.

&nbsp;

#### Implementing the `then()` method

`Promise.prototype.then()` takes up to two arguments:

1.  The first argument is a function that is invoked when the promise is resolved, and receives the promise result. If it is not a function, it is replaced with a function that simply returns the received result.

2.  The second argument is a function that runs when the promise is rejected, and receives the reason. If it is not a function, it is replaced with a "Thrower" function.

```js
promise.then(
  (value) => {
    // handle a successful value
  },
  (reason) => {
    // handle the reason
  }
);
```

Both arguments are optional.

The `Promise.prototype.then()` returns a `Promise`:

```js
const promise = Promise.resolve('from promise');
const thenPromise = promise.then((result) => {});

console.log(promise);
// Promise {
//   [[PromiseState]]: 'fulfilled',
//   [[PromiseResult]]: 'from promise',
// }
console.log(thenPromise);
// Promise {
//   [[PromiseState]]: 'pending',
//   [[PromiseResult]]: undefined,
// }

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(thenPromise);
});
// Promise {
//   [[PromiseState]]: 'fulfilled',
//   [[PromiseResult]]: undefined,
// }
```

Hence, the `then` method of the class `MyPromise` would look like this:

```js
then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
  // to do

  return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {});
}
```

1. **Handling the first argument in our `then()` method**

   Since the callback function runs when the promise is resolved, it cannot be executed within the `then()` method.

   For example:

   ```js
   class MyPromise {
     #state;
     #result;

     constructor(executor) {
       this.#state = 'pending';
       this.#result = undefined;

       try {
         executor(this.#resolve.bind(this), this.#reject.bind(this));
       } catch (error) {
         this.#reject(error);
       }
     }

     #resolve(value) {
       // ...
       this.#state = 'fulfilled';
       this.#result = value;
     }

     then(onFulfilled) {
       onFulfilled(this.#result);
     }
   }

   const p = new MyPromise((resolve) => {
     resolve(10);
   }).then((value) => {
     console.log(value); // 10
   });
   ```

   Although the code above seems to work, it doesn't work as intended when the promise is resolved asynchronously, even if the `onFulfilled()` is called asynchronously:

   ```js
   class MyPromise {
     // ...

     then(onFulfilled) {
       // Call `onFulfilled()` asynchronously.
       queueMicrotask(() => {
         onFulfilled(this.#result);
       });
     }
   }

   const p = new MyPromise((resolve) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       resolve(10);
     }, 0);
   }).then((value) => {
     console.log(value); // undefined
   });
   ```

   Therefore, the `onFulfilled()` function should be called within the `#resolve()` method and the `then()` method just registers the `onFulfilled()` function. The `onFulfilled()` function is like a subscriber, subscribing to the promised result, and the `then()` method is kind of like the function `subscribe()` in the Publisher/Subscriber Pattern, which receives subscriber callbacks and stores/registers them in some data structures.

   ```js
   class MyPromise {
     // ...
     #onFulfilled;

     constructor(executor) {
       // ...
       this.#onFulfilled = undefined;
       // ...
     }

     #resolve(value) {
       //...
       this.#onFulfilled(this.#result);
     }

     // ...

     then(onFulfilled) {
       // If `onFulfilled` is not a function, replace it with a function
       // that simply returns the received result.
       this.#onFulfilled =
         typeof onFulfilled === 'function' ? onFulfilled : (value) => value;

       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
     }
   }
   ```

   Although the `then` method will be triggered instantly, the callback functions (handlers) will be invoked asynchronously. `Promise` uses the _microtask_ queue to run the callbacks. When a promise is settled, its `then` handlers are add into the microtask queue. [The microtasks get run whenever JavaScript finishes executing, in other words, whenever the JavaScript stack becomes empty](https://youtu.be/cCOL7MC4Pl0?t=1475):

   ```js
   console.log('Start!');

   setTimeout(() => {
     console.log('Timeout!');
   }, 0);

   Promise.resolve('Promise!').then((value) => {
     console.log(value);
   });

   console.log('End!');

   // Logs:
   // 'Start!'
   // 'End!'
   // 'Promise!'
   // 'Timeout!'
   ```

   To queue an function for execution in the microtask queue, we could use the function [queueMicrotask()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/queueMicrotask):

   ```js
   #resolve(value) {
     //...
     queueMicroTask(() => {
       this.#onFulfilled(this.#result);
     });
   }
   ```

   Next, we need to handle the value returned by the `onFulfilled()` function.

   In the `Promise`, if the `onFulfilled()` function:

   - returns a value, the promise returned by `then()` gets resolved with the returned value as its value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.resolve('from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then((value) => {
       return 'from then handler';
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'fulfilled',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: 'from then handler',
     // }
     ```

   - doesn't return anything, the promise returned by `then()` gets resolved with an `undefined` value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.resolve('from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then((value) => {
       console.log(value); // 'from promise'
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'fulfilled',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: undefined,
     // }
     ```

   - throws an error, the promise returned by `then()` gets rejected with the error as its value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.resolve('from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then((value) => {
       throw new Error('error from then handler');
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'rejected',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: Error: error from then handler.
     // }
     ```

   - returns an already fulfilled promise, the promise returned by `then()` gets resolved with that promise's value as its value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.resolve('from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then((value) => {
       return Promise.resolve('resolved promise returned by then handler');
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'fulfilled',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: 'resolved promise returned by then handler',
     // }
     ```

   - returns an already rejected promise, the promise returned by `then()` gets rejected with that promise's value as its value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.resolve('promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then((value) => {
       return Promise.reject('rejected promise returned by then handler');
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'rejected',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: 'rejected promise returned by then handler',
     // }
     ```

   - returns a **pending** promise, the promise returned by `then()` gets resolved or rejected after the the promise returned by the handler gets resolved or rejected. The resolved value of the promise returned by `then()` will be the same as the resolved value of the promise returned by the handler.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.resolve('promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then((value) => {
       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         setTimeout(() => {
           resolve('resolved promise returned by then handler');
         }, 3000);
       });
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise); // Promise {<pending>}
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
       // Promise {<fulfilled>: "resolved promise returned by then handler"}
     }, 4000);
     ```

   Therefore, we need to make the `resolve()` and `reject()` of the promise returned by `then()` available in the `#resolve()` method, so that they can be invoked with the value returned by the `onFulfilled()` function. We could define two properties on `MyPromise` to store both functions:

   ```js
   class MyPromise {
     // ...
     #thenPromiseResolve;
     #thenPromiseReject;

     constructor(executor) {
       // ...
       this.#thenPromiseResolve = undefined;
       this.#thenPromiseReject = undefined;

       // ...
     }

     // ...

     then(onFulfilled) {
       // ...
       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         this.#thenPromiseResolve = resolve;
         this.#thenPromiseReject = reject;
       });
     }
   }
   ```

   If the `onFulfilled()` function returns a value or `undefined`, we could just call `this.#thenPromiseResolve()` and pass the return value to it:

   ```js
    #resolve(value) {
      // ...
      queueMicroTask(() => {
        const returnValue = this.#onFulfilled(this.#result);

        if (!(returnValue instanceof MyPromise)) {
          this.#thenPromiseResolve(returnValue);
        } else {
          // do something else
        }
     });
   }
   ```

   If the return value is an instance of `MyPromise`, we need to wait for the promise to be settled and then resolve/reject the promise returned by the `then()` method. To accomplish this, we could call the `then()` method of the return value, passing `this.#thenPromiseResolve` and `this.#thenPromiseReject` as the `then` handlers.

   ```js
   #resolve(value) {
     // ...
     queueMicroTask(() => {
       const returnValue = this.#onFulfilled(this.#result);

       if (!(returnValue instanceof MyPromise)) {
         this.#thenPromiseResolve(returnValue);
       } else {
         returnValue.then(
           this.#thenPromiseResolve,
           this.#thenPromiseReject,
         );
       }
     });
   }
   ```

   To catch any errors thrown by the `this.#onFulfilled()` function, we could use a `try...catch` statement:

   ```js
   #resolve(value) {
     // ...
     queueMicroTask(() => {
       try {
        // ...
       } catch (error) {
         this.#thenPromiseReject(error);
       }
     });
   }
   ```

   In addition, we also need to ensure `this.#onFulfilled` is not `undefined`, since `then()` might not be called:

   ```js
   const promise = Promise.resolve('foo');

   promise.then((result) => {
     return 'bar';
   });
   // The promise returned by `then` is resolved, but there
   // is no further action with the promise. Therefore, when
   // the`#resolve()` method of the returned promise runs,
   // `this.#onFulfilled` would be `undefined`.
   ```

2. **Handling the second argument in our `then()` method**

   The second callback function runs when the promise is rejected. Like the first argument, the `then()` method should register the second callback function, so that `#reject()` can execute it asynchronously whenever the promise is rejected:

   ```js
   class MyPromise {
     // ...
     #onRejected;

     constructor(executor) {
       // ...
       this.#onRejected = undefined;
       // ...
     }

     // ...

     #reject(reason) {
       //...
       queueMicrotask(() => {
         this.#onRejected(this.#result);
       });
     }

     // ...

     then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
       // ...

       // If `onRejected` is not a function, replace it with a
       // function that throws the received argument.
       this.#onRejected =
         typeof onRejected === 'function'
           ? onRejected
           : (reason) => {
               throw reason;
             };

       // ...
     }
   }
   ```

   Now we need to handle the value returned by the `onRejected()` function.

   In the `Promise`, if the `onRejected`:

   - is not a function, the `onRejected` is replaced with a function that throws the received argument, and the promise returned by `then()` gets rejected with that promise's value as its value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.reject('error from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then((value) => {});

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Uncaught (in promise) error from promise
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'rejected',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: 'error from promise',
     // }
     ```

   - throws an error, the promise returned by `then()` gets rejected with the thrown error as its value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.reject('error from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then(null, (reason) => {
       throw new Error('Error from onRejected');
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'rejected',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: Error: Error from onRejected
     // }
     ```

   - doesn't return anything, the promise returned by `then()` gets resolved with an `undefined` value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.reject('error from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then(null, (reason) => {
       console.log(reason);
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'fulfilled',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: undefined
     // }
     ```

   - returns a value, the promise returned by `then()` gets resolved with the returned value as its value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.reject('error from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then(null, (reason) => {
       return 'value returned by onRejected handler';
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'fulfilled',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: 'value returned by onRejected handler'
     // }
     ```

   - returns an already fulfilled promise, the promise returned by `then()` gets resolved with that promise's value as its value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.reject('error from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then(null, (reason) => {
       return Promise.resolve(
         'resolved promise returned by onRejected handler'
       );
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'fulfilled',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: 'resolved promise returned by onRejected handler'
     // }
     ```

   - returns an already rejected promise, the promise returned by `then()` gets rejected with that promise's value as its value.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.reject('error from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then(null, (reason) => {
       return Promise.reject('rejected promise returned by onRejected handler');
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
     });
     // Promise {
     //   [[PromiseState]]: 'rejected',
     //   [[PromiseResult]]: 'rejected promise returned by onRejected handler'
     // }
     ```

   - returns a **pending** promise, the promise returned by `then()` gets resolved or rejected after the promise returned by the handler gets resolved or rejected.

     ```js
     const promise = Promise.reject('error from promise');

     const thenPromise = promise.then(null, (reason) => {
       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         setTimeout(() => {
           resolve('resolved promise returned by onRejected handler');
         }, 3000);
       });
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise); // Promise {<pending>}
     });

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(thenPromise);
       // Promise {<fulfilled>: "resolved promise returned by onRejected handler"}
     }, 4000);
     ```

   As we can see it is basically the same as the `onFulfilled()`. We could update our `#reject()` method like below:

   ```js
   #reject(reason) {
     // ...
     queueMicrotask(() => {
       if (!this.#onRejected) return;

       try {
         const returnValue = this.#onRejected(this.#result);

         if (!(returnValue instanceof MyPromise)) {
           this.#thenPromiseResolve(returnValue);
         } else {
           returnValue.then(this.#thenPromiseResolve, this.#thenPromiseReject);
         }
       } catch (error) {
         this.#thenPromiseReject(error);
       }
     });
   }
   ```

&nbsp;

#### Implementing the `catch()` method

In the `Promise`, we can also use the `catch()` method to handle rejected cases. The `Promise.prototype.catch()` also returns a `Promise`.

The syntax is:

```js
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  throw 'Uh-oh!';
});

promise1.catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
// expected output: Uh-oh!
```

Calling the `catch()` method is exactly the same as calling `Promise.prototype.then(null, errorHandlingFunction)`. [In fact, calling obj.catch(onRejected) internally calls obj.then(undefined, onRejected)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch).

Hence, we could implement our `catch()` method this way:

```js
catch(onRejected) {
  return this.then(null, onRejected);
}
```

&nbsp;

#### Implementing the static method `MyPromise.resolve()`

In the native `Promise`, the static method `Promise.resolve()` returns a `Promise` object that is resolved with a given value:

- Resolving a string:

  ```js
  Promise.resolve('Success').then(
    (value) => {
      console.log(value); // "Success"
    },
    (reason) => {
      // not called
    }
  );
  ```

- Resolving another `Promise`:

  ```js
  const original = Promise.resolve(33);
  const cast = Promise.resolve(original);
  cast.then(function (value) {
    console.log('value: ' + value);
  });
  console.log('original === cast?: ' + (original === cast));

  // logs:
  // original === cast?: true
  // value: 33

It is worth pointing out that [Promise.resolve() also handle the case where the value is a thenable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve#resolving_thenables_and_throwing_errors). However, we don't need to cover it here.

In `MyPromise.resolve()`, we could first check if the value received is an instance of `MyPromise`. If it is, we could just return it. Otherwise we return a new instance of `MyPromise` and resolve the promise with the given value.

```js
static resolve(value) {
  if (value instanceof MyPromise) return value;

  return new MyPromise((resolve) => {
    resolve(value);
  });
}
```

#### Implementing the static method `MyPromise.reject()`

In the native `Promise`, the static method `Promise.reject()` returns a `Promise` object that is rejected with a given reason:

```js
Promise.reject(new Error('fail')).then(
  (value) => {
    // not called
  },
  (reason) => {
    console.log(reason); // Error: fail
  }
);
```

We could implement our `MyPromise.reject()` like this:

```js
static reject(reason) {
  return new MyPromise((_, reject) => {
    reject(reason);
  });
}
```

&nbsp;

### Implementation

```js
class MyPromise {
  #state;
  #result;
  #onFulfilled;
  #onRejected;
  #thenPromiseResolve;
  #thenPromiseReject;

  constructor(executor) {
    this.#state = 'pending';
    this.#result = undefined;
    this.#onFulfilled = undefined;
    this.#onRejected = undefined;
    this.#thenPromiseResolve = undefined;
    this.#thenPromiseReject = undefined;

    try {
      executor(this.#resolve.bind(this), this.#reject.bind(this));
    } catch (error) {
      this.#reject(error);
    }
  }

  #resolve(value) {
    if (this.#state !== 'pending') return;

    this.#state = 'fulfilled';
    this.#result = value;

    queueMicrotask(() => {
      if (
        !this.#onFulfilled ||
        !this.#thenPromiseResolve ||
        !this.#thenPromiseReject
      ) {
        return;
      }

      try {
        const returnValue = this.#onFulfilled(this.#result);

        if (!(returnValue instanceof MyPromise)) {
          this.#thenPromiseResolve(returnValue);
        } else {
          returnValue.then(this.#thenPromiseResolve, this.#thenPromiseReject);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        this.#thenPromiseReject(error);
      }
    });
  }

  #reject(reason) {
    if (this.#state !== 'pending') return;

    this.#state = 'rejected';
    this.#result = reason;

    queueMicrotask(() => {
      if (
        !this.#onRejected ||
        !this.#thenPromiseResolve ||
        !this.#thenPromiseReject
      ) {
        return;
      }

      try {
        const returnValue = this.#onRejected(this.#result);

        if (!(returnValue instanceof MyPromise)) {
          this.#thenPromiseResolve(returnValue);
        } else {
          returnValue.then(this.#thenPromiseResolve, this.#thenPromiseReject);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        this.#thenPromiseReject(error);
      }
    });
  }

  then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    // Register consuming functions.
    this.#onFulfilled =
      typeof onFulfilled === 'function' ? onFulfilled : (value) => value;
    this.#onRejected =
      typeof onRejected === 'function'
        ? onRejected
        : (reason) => {
            throw reason;
          };

    return new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
      // Register `resolve` and `reject`, so that we can
      // resolve or reject this promise in `#resolve`
      // or `#reject`.
      this.#thenPromiseResolve = resolve;
      this.#thenPromiseReject = reject;
    });
  }

  catch(onRejected) {
    return this.then(undefined, onRejected);
  }

  static resolve(value) {
    if (value instanceof MyPromise) return value;

    return new MyPromise((resolve) => {
      resolve(value);
    });
  }

  static reject(reason) {
    return new MyPromise((_, reject) => {
      reject(reason);
    });
  }
}
```

### Note:

The above solution doesn't handle the following cases:

1. When calling the `then()` method asynchronously, it wouldn't properly trigger the handler passed to `then()`. (Credits to [L1ef6Zi](https://bigfrontend.dev/user/L1ef6Zi)

   For instance:

   ```js
   const promise = MyPromise.resolve(1);

   setTimeout(() => {
     promise.then(console.log);
   });
   ```

   To handle this, we could check the state of the promise in the `then()` method. If the promise is already fulfilled, we could execute the `onFulfilled()` immediately.

2. The `#resolve()` doesn't handle the case when the initial resolved value is a promise. (Credits to [L1ef6Zi](https://bigfrontend.dev/user/L1ef6Zi)

   For example:

   ```js
   const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
     resolve(Promise.resolve(1));
   });
   // `PromiseResult` is `1`

   const promise = new MyPromise((resolve) => {
     resolve(MyPromise.resolve(1));
   });
   // `PromiseResult` is another promise
   ```

   To address this, we could check whether the `value` is an instance of `MyPromise` in the `#resolve()` method. If that is the case, we could call the `value`'s `then()` method and pass in `(value) => { this.#result = value; }` as the parameter:

   ```js
   class MyPromise {
     // ...

     #resolve(value) {
       // ...

       if (value instanceof MyPromise) {
         value.then((value) => {
           this.#state = 'fulfilled';
           this.#result = value;
         });
       } else {
         this.#state = 'fulfilled';
         this.#result = value;
       }

       // ...
     }

     // ...
   }

   const myPromise1 = new MyPromise((resolve) => {
     resolve(MyPromise.resolve(1));
   });
   console.log('myPromise1: ', myPromise1);

   const promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => {
     resolve(Promise.resolve(1));
   });
   console.log('promise1: ', promise1);

   // logs (Chrome):
   // myPromise1:  MyPromise {state: 'pending'}
   // promise1:  Promise {<pending>}
   //
   // When we expand the object, we get:
   // MyPromise {
   //   #result: 1
   //   #state: "fulfilled"
   // }
   // Promise {
   //   [[PromiseState]]: "fulfilled"
   //   [[PromiseResult]]: 1
   // }

   const myPromise2 = new MyPromise((resolve) => {
     resolve(
       new MyPromise((resolve) => {
         setTimeout(() => {
           resolve(1);
         }, 1000);
       })
     );
   });
   console.log('myPromise2: ', myPromise2);

   const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => {
     resolve(
       new Promise((resolve) => {
         setTimeout(() => {
           resolve(1);
         }, 1000);
       })
     );
   });
   console.log('promise2: ', promise2);

   // logs (Chrome):
   // myPromise2:  MyPromise {state: 'pending'}
   // Promise {<pending>}
   //
   // When we expand the object, we get:
   // MyPromise {
   //   #result: 1
   //   #state: "fulfilled"
   // }
   // Promise {
   //   [[PromiseState]]: "fulfilled"
   //   [[PromiseResult]]: 1
   // }
   ```

3. The solution doesn't handle multiple `then()` for the same promise. (Credits to [1aN6SC9](https://bigfrontend.dev/user/1aN6SC9))

   For example:

   ```js
   const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       resolve(44);
     }, 1000);
   });
   promise.then((value) => console.log('value1: ', value));
   promise.then((value) => console.log('value2: ', value));
   // logs:
   // value1: 44
   // value2: 44

   const myPromise = new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       resolve(44);
     }, 1000);
   });
   myPromise.then((value) => console.log('value1: ', value));
   myPromise.then((value) => console.log('value2: ', value));
   // logs:
   // value2: 44
   ```

   To handle this, we could use an array to store the `then` handlers.
