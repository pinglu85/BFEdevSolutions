### Problem Description

what is Composition? It is actually not that difficult to understand, see [@dan_abramov 's explanation](https://whatthefuck.is/composition).

Here you are asked to create a `pipe()` function, which chains multiple functions together to create a new function.

Suppose we have some simple functions like this

```js
const times = (y) => (x) => x * y;
const plus = (y) => (x) => x + y;
const subtract = (y) => (x) => x - y;
const divide = (y) => (x) => x / y;
```

Your `pipe()` would be used to generate new functions

```js
pipe([times(2), times(3)]);
// x _ 2 _ 3

pipe([times(2), plus(3), times(4)]);
// (x _ 2 + 3) _ 4

pipe([times(2), subtract(3), divide(4)]);
// (x \* 2 - 3) / 4
```

**notes**

1. to make things simple, functions passed to `pipe()` will all accept 1 argument

#

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {Array<(arg: any) => any>} funcs
 * @return {(arg: any) => any}
 */
function pipe(funcs) {
  return function (n) {
    let result = n;
    for (let func of funcs) {
      result = func(result);
    }
    return result;
  };
}
```
